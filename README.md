E-commerce Customer Segmentation

Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of an E-commerce dataset, recording purchases of approximately ~4000 customers over one year. The aim is to build an advanced predictive model that can anticipate future purchases for new customers based on their initial transactions.

Key Features and Methodologies:

Data Preparation and Cleaning: Loading, inspecting, and normalizing the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing customer distribution by country, analyzing order cancellation patterns, and examining product codes and customer spending.
Product Category Analysis: Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze product descriptions, advanced data encoding, and clustering products using K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms.
Customer Segmentation: Aggregating product data, temporally segmenting orders, and applying hierarchical clustering to identify patterns. Forming customer segments using one-hot encoding, feature engineering, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means clustering.
Advanced Machine Learning Models: Implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost), and Neural Networks.
Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models using Voting Classifier and Stacking Models to enhance predictive performance.
Model Validation and Evaluation: Splitting data into training and test sets, using cross-validation techniques, and evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Final Insights and Conclusion: Summarizing key findings, discussing future work and potential improvements, and highlighting business implications.
